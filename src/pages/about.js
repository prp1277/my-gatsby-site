       I'm originally from Omaha, NE, went to Missouri State University in Springfield, MO and moved to Kansas City after graduating in December 2015.

            I'm hosting the content on Github Pages, using Gatsby to compile everything and Netlify for continuous integration. 
            It's all a little more complicated than I'd planned, but I've learned a lot along the way. 
            There's still a lot more I have to learn (images are pretty high on that list), but that will come in time.
