          I'm hosting the content on Github Pages, using Gatsby to compile everything and Netlify for continuous integration. 
          It's all a little more complicated than I'd planned, but I've learned a lot along the way. 
          There's still a lot more I have to learn (images are pretty high on that list), but that will come in time.</p>
