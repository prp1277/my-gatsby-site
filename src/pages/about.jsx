          I'm originally
          <b>from Omaha, NE, went to Missouri State University</b> in
          Springfield, MO and moved to Kansas City after graduating in December
          2015 with a <b>B.S. in Finance and a Minor in Accounting.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>
            My background since graduating has primarily been focused on
            business operations
          </b>, first in the call center at Waddell & Reed, then in Mutual Fund
          Operations at State Street and most recently in the FoodService
          Industry with Reinhart FoodService.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>
            During my time with State Street, I identified the dependence on
            Microsoft Excel and decided to learn everything that I could about
            the software.
          </b>{" "}
          Using Microsoft OneNote, I created documentation for Formulas,
          Keyboard Shortcuts and general notes to help improve my skills. This
          did not go unnoticed, and a few months later I applied and accepted a
          role as the Purchasing Assistant at Reinhart Foodservice.
        </p>
        <p>
          At Reinhart, I continued to advance my Excel skills. I starting with
          <b> VBA Macros to automate daily and weekly tasks.</b> When I learned
          about Power Queries I started mixing and matching between the two,
          using VBA primarily for formatting and Power Queries for analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
          After diving deeper into Power Query I stumbled upon the free, desktop
          version of Power BI. Since it used the familiar Power Pivot features I
          had previously learned, the learning curve came naturally and{" "}
          <b>
            I immediately preferred Power Bi's ETL model for cleaning data and
            creating visualizations.
          </b>
        </p>
        <p>
          After parting ways with Reinhart in late February I realized that the
          skills that I had developed were great, but they were only a subset of
          the bigger picture. Power BI opened my eyes to the fact that ypu can
          literally get data from anywhere.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>
            Since then, I've built two websites (you're looking at version 2),
            familiarized myself with JS, HTML and CSS and learned a few hard
            lessons about Data Science.
          </b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout my experiences I've found that observing a process from
          end-to-end, noting the details, and interpreting the results is the
          key to developing business insights.
