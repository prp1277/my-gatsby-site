# Linear and Multivariate Objects

I don't get them. That was apparent as I studied for my first test in my Stats and Machine Learning class. That was confirmed as I took my second test tonight, so technically, I tested the Null hypothesis, right?

The worst part is that I know the exact root of my confusion, I just don't know how to simply or explain the process to myself without getting super fucking confused.

At the base level it's no different than Finance. You have an _expected value_ and a _predictive value_. The expected value is the projected return... a use-case estimate of the best / worst case scenario. That's easy enough for a simpleton like me to get my head around.

| Case | Probability  | Result |
|------|--------------|--------|
| > Best case     | 25%  | Best  
| > Mediocre case | 10%  | Mid  
| > Total chaos   |  5%  | Worst
