I've had a hard time over the past few months getting accustomed to the fundamentals of programming and I think I just had the revelation that I've been waiting for since March.

## The Formula Bar & The Command Line

I was reading the [documentation for Microsoft Office Add-ins]("https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins") earlier and after finishing and thinking about the topics in a broader sense when I came to the realization that I should have had months ago - the formula bar in Excel is not a whole lot different from a command line interface.

If you think about it, the command line is exactly that, a single line of code. Sure, it can be `int` long, but with all the folding that happens it remains a single, `=CONCAT(range[1], range[2], ... )` function. I think that's what caused so much confusion for me in both Javascript and R. Admittedly, I shouldn't have been messing around with JavaScript while I was taking classes focused on R, but hind-sight is 20-20.

I was using VBA with Power Query M earlier to calculate how poor I am and ran into some problems with my Personal Macro Workbook. I figured it's Saturday, I haven't used the Visual Basic Editor in awhile and I know Microsoft just finished their business apps summit, let's see what changes they've made.
