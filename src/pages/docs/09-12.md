# I Am Not a Developer

My background is in Finance and Accounting. I majored in Finance and minored in Accounting in college and started working in the financial services industry soon after. As you may imagine, this requires an in-depth understanding of financial equations, concepts and, of course, Microsoft Excel.

Although most people loath spreadsheets, I found solace in them. The days of calculating the time value of money using my [BA-II Plus](https://sep.yimg.com/ay/pospaper-store/baiiplus-financial-calculator-10-digit-lcd-12.jpg) went out the window as soon as left academia. Of course, we had been assigned Excel projects in a few of my classes, but most the projects had a limited scope such as: _"Create an Income Statement, Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Statement given these criteria..."_. This was great to drive home the concepts that we were learning in class, but didn't do a great job to prepare us for _real_ finance.

## My Introduction to Programming

It wasn't until I was a full year out of college that I started using Excel extensively. After graduating I had accepted a role as a Customer Service Representative in the Call Center of a mutual fund company and focused on soft-skills more than knowledge of financial calculations. It wasn't until I got fired from the call center and started working as a Mutual Fund Accountant that I realized the full reach of Microsoft's signature spreadsheet program.

The bank that I was working for is responsible for "over 10% of the world's assets", and relies on Microsoft's full software stack to service these assets. Excel files, OneNote documentation and Access databases were the sparks that ignited my interest in programming. Most of my day-to-day time was spent running Excel macros that someone else had written and I had no idea how to debug. All I knew was that Files X, Y and Z had to be saved with a certain name in a certain directory as documented by the OneNote, otherwise I was going to have a ![bad time](https://imgur.com/wWdmqMj).

Over the period of my 6-month contract I identified the reliance on our VBA specialist, Luke, and made it my goal to start understanding some of the code behind the macros I ran each day. I had grown accustomed to using OneNote for documentation and started my own notebook at home to help me learn. I started with keyboard shortcuts, tables of functions and links to forums with plans to basically create a documentation database.

As my notebook grew my skills followed and about 5 months into my contract I heard of an open position as a Purchasing Assistant at a foodservice company and sent in my application.

### After 3 interviews and 2 bachelor parties I found myself working in the Foodservice Industry.

As the first Purchasing Assistant the division had ever hired, I was tasked with providing analysis and supporting documentation as well as purchasing my own line of food.
