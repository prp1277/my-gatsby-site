## Background Information

I've been using Excel for years. In college, I majored in Finance and Minored in Accounting, then graduated and started working in the Financial Services industry. If you're not familiar with the Financial Services industry I'll share 2 secrets with you:  

1. _The world runs on Microsoft Excel_ and <br/>
2. _Excel can do damn near anything_.

> [Case](https://www.slideshare.net/ntweisen/20-unique-uses-of-excel-spreadsheets) and [point](https://chandoo.org/wp/unusual-excel-uses/)

As I attempt to learn how to program I have a tendency to revert back to Excel as my go to GUI / IDE.

## Set-Up

Setting up your workbook for this tutorial is extremely simple. All you need to do is create a list of hyperlinks in your workbook. It doesn't matter where they come from, all that matters is that they are formatted to have a text to display and an underlying address.

> This is equivalent to an `<a href="" alt=""/>` in HTML

## Defining the Problem

Now we have a column populated by underlined-blue text, indicating that they are hyperlinks. Sure, we can click them, but they aren't much use in a markdown document formatted this way. We'll have to separate the `Address` from the `Text to display`. 

In smaller lists that's not a big deal, but this is a pretty long list. Moreover, this is a common, everyday task I've seared into my brain:
> `Copy Link > Paste into OneNote > ctrl+k > ctrl+v`

Although the task is nearly identical in Excel, it's going to take forever to click through them one by one: 
> `ctrl+k > ctrl+c > ctrl+R > tab > ctrl+v > enter`

### Ready to jam that pen through your ear yet?
**Good.**

We have the keystrokes down to an art, why don't we use the macro recorder to take a peek under Excel's hood.

## Reviewing the Recording

### Part 1 - Absolute References

```visual-basic
    Sub Macro1()
'
        Range("A2").Select              '|First Link
        Selection.Hyperlinks(1).Delete  '|
        Range("B2").Select              '|
        ActiveSheet.Paste               '|_
        Range("A3").Select              '|Second Link
        Selection.Hyperlinks(1).Delete  '|
        Range("B3").Select              '|
        ActiveSheet.Paste               '|_
        Range("A4").Select              '|Third Link
        Selection.Hyperlinks(1).Delete  '|
```

### Part 2 - Relative References

```visual-basic
        ActiveCell.Offset(0, 1).Range("A1").Select
        ActiveSheet.Paste
        ActiveCell.Offset(1, -1).Range("A1").Select
        Selection.Hyperlinks(1).Delete
        ActiveCell.Offset(0, 1).Range("A1").Select
        ActiveSheet.Paste
        ActiveCell.Offset(1, -1).Range("A1").Select
        Selection.Hyperlinks(1).Delete
        ActiveCell.Offset(0, 1).Range("A1").Select
        ActiveSheet.Paste
    End Sub

```

Stay tuned for Part 2, where we'll dive into the recording output and finish up our template.
